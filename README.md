# Sudoku Solver - Java (Backtracking Algorithm)

## Internship Track
SkillCraft Technology - Software Engineering (Task 3)

## Description
A Java implementation of a 9x9 Sudoku solver using the Backtracking algorithm.

## Features
- Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
- Recursive backtracking approach
- Validity checking (row, column, 3x3 subgrid)
- Formatted board display

## Algorithm Used
Backtracking:
The algorithm fills empty cells by trying digits 1-9 and recursively validates the solution until the board is solved.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Recursion
- 2D Arrays
- Backtracking Algorithm

## How to Run
1. Compile:
   javac Sudoku.java
2. Run:
   java Sudoku

## Learning Outcome
- Recursive problem solving
- Constraint validation logic
- Algorithm implementation# SCT_SD_3
